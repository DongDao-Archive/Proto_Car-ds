# Car-ds

## Project overview
### Concept
Car-ds is an **action-racing game** where the player controls an experimental race car as they try to **survive an ongoing zombie apocalypse**.
The **main mechanic** centres around the variety of **power-ups** the car generates; which the player manages with a **card-based system**. These power-up cards are to be used tactically to successfully outrun a pursuing horde of zombies.

## How to play?
**On Windows**
The executable game file (.exe) is at:
Project root/Packaged/Final

**On other platforms**
The link to a HTML build of the game is at:
Project root/Packaged/Final/GameLink.txt

## Development
### Overview
Car-ds was developed for an assignment in one of my game design unit. We were given approximately 3 weeks to design and build the game from start to finish. 
As the assignment was centred around the design aspect of game development, we put more emphasis on the design of Car-ds (i.e. the card mechanic and game/story progression) and less on the aesthetic of it. After all, our target was a functional, low fidelity prototype.
